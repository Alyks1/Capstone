# Capstone Project Scraper
This website uses a scraper to gather information from user inputted websites to create a dataset of images of historical artifacts and their corrisbonding date.
The idea is to attempt to use the dataset in the future to try to predict artifact ages from their image.

## Docker
To run the docker image, run:
`$ docker run -p 5001:3000 scraper`
