            This scraper creates a Dataset of images and year numbers of artifacts by scraping a selection of websites
            specified by the user.
            <br><br>
            The dataset produced, is a list of images paired with their corrisponding year of creation.
            It contains a CSV file that maps each image to its year of creation and a trust score, which
            can be used to determine the accuracy of the year of creation. The trust score is calculated by taking
            into account the trust parameters given by the user and a form of proof-of-work where data with more
            information is seen as more likly to be correct.
            <br><br>
            Once scraped (Start), the dataset can be downloaded from the Display Data page.
