            This scraper creates a Dataset of images and year numbers of artifacts by scraping a selection of websites
            specified by the user.
            <br>
            The dataset produced, is a list of images paired with their corrisponding year of creation.
            It contains a CSV file (_datasetInfo.csv), which maps each image to its year of creation and a trust score,
            which can be used to determine the accuracy of the year of creation.
            <br><br>
            Tip: To find the _datasetInfo.csv file in the dataset, sort by name in decending order.
            <br><br>
            The trust score is calculated by taking into account the trust parameters given by the user and a form of
            proof-of-work where data with more information is seen as more likely to be correct. However, the user can
            easily remove data from the dataset via the Display Data page.
            <br><br>
            Once scraped (Start), the dataset can be downloaded from the Display Data page.
