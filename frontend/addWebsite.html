            Currently supported websites are subreddits from Reddit.com and old.reddit.com, and the Kunst Historische
            Museum in Vienna under khm.at.
            More websites will be added in the future.
            <br><br>
            The website weight is a number between 0-1 that acts as a multiplier for the data being scraped from the
            website. The more accurate the website, the higher the website weight should be. For example, trusting the
            Kunst Historische Museum more and Reddit less would be ideal.
            <br><br>
            The Number of pages indicates how much from the website to scrape. Currently this is maxed at 10 but this
            will be changed in the future.<br>
            Please note that some websites have a limit on how many pages can be scraped.
